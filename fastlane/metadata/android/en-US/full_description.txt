Nudge helps you reclaim your phone in 2 ways:

✅Blocking addicting apps so you can't access them.
✅Suggesting alternative ways to use your phone.

Addicting apps will draw you in and before you know it, you'll find yourself opening them reflexively. You open your phone and 15 minutes later you realize you've just been scrolling through some feed.

There are always going to be times you're bored and want to pull out your phone. The trick to beating phone addiction is to redirect that energy in the moment of need. Instead of mindlessly scrolling, read a book or take a deep breath.

Nudge breaks the habit cycle by intercepting and redirecting you right before you start using an addicting app. It provides an easier alternative to do something positive.
